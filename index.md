## Welcome to the Lyfe Wiki

"Lyfe is a discord bot that has an inventory system, trading, jobs, crime and more as ideas come into my head. It's a rather random project I came up with while not having much to do and intend to continue it until there's always something for a player to do if they wish to use the bot, where that be a game, challenge or fun feature." - Marco (Creator of Lyfe)

### Getting started
Inviting the bot to your server is simple! All you need to do is click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=730874220078170122&permissions=519232&scope=bot). The bot only requires a few permissions to work as intended, so make sure you don't accidently remove them! 
If you have a channel called "general", a message will send with some basic information to help you start your epic adventure! You can bring get the message again by doing `,welcome`. Check out the commands below for a detailed view on how things work!

### A few things you should know
Lyfe is a cross server "game" meaning you are competing against players from other servers. Commands like `,leaderboard` or `,baltop` will include people from other servers other than your own. Because of this, there is a chance of people abusing the bot for malicious or annoying purposes. Please report and of this to the [support server](https://discord.gg/zAZ3vKJ). In no way shape or form should this bot be used for Malicious Intent and you must abide by the [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) when using it. People found breaking our rules or [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) will be blacklisted from using the bot. This includes individuals and/or servers.

The main command is `,help`. This brings up the help menu where you can then view all the different aspects of Lyfe. Do `,help (category)` to view the different commands for that area. If you need more help, visit our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/zAZ3vKJ)
