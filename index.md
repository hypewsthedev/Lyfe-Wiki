## Welcome to the Lyfe Wiki

Lyfe is a discord bot that has an inventory system, trading, jobs, crime and more as ideas come into my head. It's a rather random project I came up with while not having much to do and intend to continue it until there's always something for a player to do if they wish to use the bot, where that be a game, challenge or fun feature.

### Getting started
Inviting the bot to your server is simple! All you need to do is click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=730874220078170122&permissions=519232&scope=bot). The bot only requires a few permissions to work as intended, so make sure you don't accidently remove them! 
If you have a channel called "general", a message will send with some basic information to help you start your epic adventure! You can bring get the message again by doing `,welcome`. Check out the commands below for a detailed view on how things work!
