## Welcome to the Lyfe Wiki

Lyfe is a discord bot that has an inventory system, trading, jobs, crime and more as ideas come into my head. It's a rather random project I came up with while not having much to do and intend to continue it until there's always something for a player to do if they wish to use the bot, where that be a game, challenge or fun feature.
