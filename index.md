## Welcome to the Lyfe Wiki

Lyfe is a discord bot that has an inventory system, trading, jobs, crime and more as ideas come into my head. It's a rather random project I came up with while not having much to do and intend to continue it until there's always something for a player to do if they wish to use the bot, where that be a game, challenge or fun feature.

### Getting started
Inviting the bot to your server is simple! All you need to do is click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=730874220078170122&permissions=519232&scope=bot). The bot only requires a few permissions to work as intended, so make sure you don't accidently remove them! 
If you have a channel called "general", a message will send with some basic information to help you start your epic adventure! You can bring get the message again by doing `,welcome`. Check out the commands below for a detailed view on how things work!

### A few things you should know
Lyfe is a cross server "game" meaning you are competing against players from other servers. Commands like `,leaderboard` or `,baltop` will include people from other servers other than your own. Because of this, there is a chance of people abusing the bot for malicious or annoying purposes. Please report and of this to the [support server](https://discord.gg/zAZ3vKJ). In no way shape or form should this bot be used for Malicious Intent and you must abide by the [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) when using it. People found breaking our rules or [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) will be blacklisted from using the bot. This includes individuals and/or servers.

### Commands
To work your way around the bot, you may need to view the commands. We have made it easy for you to view them and see their purposes inside Discord! 
The main command is `,help`. This brings up the help menu where you can then view all the different aspects of Lyfe. Do `,help (categroy)` to view the different commands for that area. If you need more help, visit our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/zAZ3vKJ)
